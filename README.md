Overview
- 
- This program is an interactive command-line tool designed to assist users with coding tasks. It offers different modes for debugging, checking code consistency, refactoring code, and even a free conversation mode where the user can interact with an AI model. The program uses Googleâ€™s Gemini AI to assist with these tasks.

Supported Languages:
- 
- Because this program is powered by Google's Gemini AI, it can proccess most modern and historical programming languages, such as Python, Javascript, C++, C, HTML, CSS, SQL, Swift, Kotlin and frameworks such as React, Angular. This is not a comprehensive list, see the "Supported Languages" file for a more complete list

Modes: 
-
- Debugging Assistance: Allows users to upload a code file and get an overview of potential issues in the code.
- Code Consistency Overview: Checks the code for consistency, highlighting any potential issues that might affect the readability or quality of the code.
- Refactoring Code: Refactors a given code file to make it more consistent, clean, and efficient.
- Free Mode: A free conversation mode where users can interact with the AI on any topic, with the ability to exit or return to the main menu at any time. 
- Exit: Not actually a mode, this is an option in the main menu to exit the program

After completing a task in Debugging Assistance, Code Consistency Overview, or Refactoring Code, the user will be asked to press any key to return to the main menu.
If the user is in free mode, simply type "exit" to exit free mode

Mode Descriptions:
- 
- Debugging Assistance: 
- - The user will be asked to provide the path to a code file they want to debug. The AI will analyze the code and provide an overview of potential issues.
- Code Consistency Overview:
- - After providing the file path, the AI will check the code for any inconsistencies and offer suggestions to improve it.
- Refactoring Code:
- - The user submits a file, and the AI will refactor it for better performance, readability, and maintainability.
- Free Mode:
- - Users can freely chat with the AI, asking questions or discussing topics. This mode ends when the user types "exit." When Free Mode ends, the user returns to the main menu
- Exiting
- - You can exit the program at any time by choosing the Exit option from the main menu

Providing File Paths:
- 
All File Paths must be absolute. An example of a valid file path is "C:\Users\user\Documents\CodeReview\AI.py", used to input the file path of "AI.py"
