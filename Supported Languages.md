Major Programming Languages:
-
- Python: Extremely popular for web development, data science, machine learning, scripting, and more. 
- JavaScript: Essential for front-end web development and increasingly used for back-end (Node.js). 
- Java: A robust, object-oriented language used for enterprise applications, Android development, and more.
- C++: A powerful language used for systems programming, game development, high-performance applications, and more.
- C#: Developed by Microsoft, used for Windows applications, game development (Unity), web development (.NET), and more.
- Go (Golang): Developed by Google, known for its efficiency and concurrency, often used for backend development and system programming.
- Ruby: Known for its elegant syntax and used for web development (Ruby on Rails), scripting, and more.
- Swift: Apple's language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.
- Kotlin: A modern language for Android development and increasingly used for server-side development.
- PHP: Primarily used for web development, often with content management systems like WordPress.

Web Development Languages (Front-end & Back-end):
- 
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The foundation of web pages, defining structure and content.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style web pages, controlling layout, colors, fonts, and more.
- JavaScript (already mentioned): Key for interactivity and dynamic behavior in web browsers.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, often used for large-scale web applications.

Frameworks and Libraries: I understand many popular web frameworks and libraries built on these languages, such as:
-
- React, Angular, Vue.js (JavaScript)
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
- Django, Flask (Python)
- ASP.NET (C#)
- Spring (Java)

Server-side Languages (many of the major languages above, plus):
- 
- Perl
- Bash/Shell scripting
- PowerShell

Data Science and Machine Learning Languages:
-
- Python (already mentioned): Dominant in data science and machine learning due to libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- R: Specifically designed for statistical computing and data visualization.
- Julia: A high-performance language gaining popularity in scientific computing and data science.
- SQL (Structured Query Language): Essential for managing and querying databases, crucial for data analysis (Supports various dialects like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

Mobile Development Languages:
- 
- Swift (already mentioned): iOS, macOS, etc.
- Kotlin (already mentioned): Android
- Java (already mentioned): Older Android development, still relevant.
- React Native (JavaScript): Cross-platform mobile development.
- Flutter (Dart): Cross-platform mobile development.
- C# (with Xamarin): Cross-platform mobile development.

Lower-Level and Systems Programming Languages:
- 
- C (already mentioned): Foundation for many operating systems and embedded systems.
- C++ (already mentioned): Systems programming, operating systems, game engines, performance-critical applications.
- Assembly Language: Low-level language specific to computer architectures.
- Rust: A modern systems programming language focused on safety and performance.

Other Notable Languages:
- 
- Lisp (various dialects like Common Lisp, Scheme): Historically important and influential, used in AI and functional programming. Partially Supported
- Haskell: A purely functional programming language. I have some understanding of Haskell.
- Scala: A multi-paradigm language running on the JVM, combining object-oriented and functional programming.
- Dart (for Flutter): Developed by Google, used for Flutter framework.
- Objective-C: Older language for Apple platforms (pre-Swift), still encountered in legacy code.
- Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET): Microsoft's older language, still used in some enterprise environments.
- COBOL: Legacy language still used in some mainframe systems (less common for modern applications). Partially Supported
- Fortran: Historically used for scientific and numerical computing, still relevant in some fields. Partially Supported
- Prolog: Logic programming language, used in AI and computational linguistics. Partially Supported

Markup Languages (Beyond HTML/CSS):
- 
- XML (Extensible Markup Language): Used for data exchange and configuration.
- YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language): Human-readable data serialization format, often used in configuration files.
- Markdown: Lightweight markup language for creating formatted text.

Query Languages (Beyond SQL):
-
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs, offering more flexibility and efficiency than traditional REST APIs.
- Cypher (for Neo4j): A query language for graph databases.
